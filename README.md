 # Sinta ðŸš€
#### Stop wasting time, hire faster and better.
A Recruitment Management System that helps recruiters to make the hiring process fast and transparent.
ðŸ”—  [Sinta Home](https://www.sintaapp.com/)

## Problem:
- Businesses spend too much time & move too slowly on hiring. On average, completing a hiring cycle will take 2-3 months
- Lack of collaboration creates the need for unnecessary meetings. Not enough information or data on what's working and what's not.

## Solution:
Sinta is a Web app that integrates with Slack's API that allows teams to quickly assess candidates realtime and reduce time to a decision.  

- Setup an interview in seconds ~ interview guides based on competencies
- Faster decisions ~ Debrief on interviews & collaborate asynchronously. Hire within days, not weeks
